## Description

StreamDeck-AudioSwitcherPlus is an Elgato Stream Deck plugin for setting the default Windows audio device. **Windows only** - macOS is not supported.

> **This is a fork** of [Fred Emmott](https://github.com/fredemmott)'s original [StreamDeck-AudioOutputSwitcher](https://github.com/fredemmott/StreamDeck-AudioOutputSwitcher), extended with additional features (hiding disabled/unplugged devices, hiding device-type suffixes, an "All" button role, stripped Windows device-name prefixes, and per-button custom icons with color selection). All credit for the original plugin, its design, and the underlying audio-switching approach goes to Fred Emmott — please check out [his other Stream Deck plugins](https://github.com/fredemmott) as well.

## Two implementations, one plugin

This repo contains two separate, independently-installable builds of the same plugin concept - same feature set (device direction, default/communication/"all" role, fuzzy device matching, custom icons/colors), different underlying tech:

| | [`audio-switcher-exe/`](audio-switcher-exe/) | [`audio-switcher-node/`](audio-switcher-node/) |
|---|---|---|
| Runtime | Native C++, compiled to its own `sdaudioswitchplus.exe` | Node.js, running inside Stream Deck's own bundled Node runtime |
| Device switching | Direct in-process COM calls | The same COM calls, via inline C# in a long-running `powershell.exe` |
| Responsiveness | Fast - real-time, in-process | Near-instant once running; the first request after it starts waits for PowerShell to start |
| Windows Smart App Control | **Can be blocked** - it's a freshly-compiled, unsigned, no-reputation executable | Not affected - never launches its own executable, so there's nothing for Smart App Control to flag |
| Status | Original, most mature | Newer, built specifically to sidestep the Smart App Control issue |

Both install and run completely independently (different plugin UUIDs, different install folders), so you can have either or both active at once. If Smart App Control isn't a problem for you, the exe version is the leaner choice (no PowerShell process alongside it); otherwise the Node version avoids being blocked at the cost of a short startup delay. See each folder's own README for setup, features, and its own troubleshooting guide.

Shared assets (the button icons, the property inspector, and the `VERSION` file both plugins take their version from) live in [`shared/`](shared/) and are pulled in by both projects' build steps rather than duplicated.

## Demo version

The Node version also builds as a free demo - only the Node version, since it's the one published on the Elgato Marketplace (the exe can't be signed). The demo is a separate plugin with its own UUID (`com.morgan-scruggs.audioswitcherplus-node-demo`), so it installs alongside the full version. The demo:

- switches between **2 output devices and 2 input devices** of the user's choice, shared by all its buttons and kept in the plugin's global settings. Picking a different device on a button frees the old one as soon as no button uses it (the property inspector records each button's devices to tell, under an ID it keeps in the button's own settings, since Stream Deck's own ID for a button isn't guaranteed to last between sessions); while both of a direction's devices are still in use, other devices show as "full version" in the device list. Deleting a key doesn't free its devices, since Stream Deck doesn't report that - so the device lists end with **Reset all device selections**, which frees all the demo's devices and puts every key back to "Choose a device…". A property inspector can only rewrite its own key, so the others are reset by a count each key is stamped with: one stamped before the latest reset counts as having no device, to the plugin straight away and to its property inspector, which clears it, when next opened.
- offers both directions, the **Default** and **Communications** roles and both kinds of matching, but not the **All** role, which is shown but disabled. With **Fuzzy** matching, a picked device still counts as one of the demo's after Windows renumbers it.
- uses one icon per direction - the **speaker** for output, the **mic** for input (colors can still be changed; Toggle's second state is dimmed by default so the two states can be told apart).

The limits are applied both in the shared property inspector, which recognizes the demo by its UUID, and in the plugin (`audio-switcher-node/src/edition.ts`), which re-applies them to every button's settings and refuses to switch to a device that isn't one of the two. They're meant to make paying easier than not, not to be tamper-proof: anyone can build the full version from this repo.

`npm run build:demo` builds it (see [the Node README](audio-switcher-node/README.md#building)). CI packages and releases it with the full versions.

## Building

Each build documents its own process - see the "Building"/"Building From Source" section of [the exe README](audio-switcher-exe/README.md#building-from-source) or [the node README](audio-switcher-node/README.md#building). Both build steps install straight into `%APPDATA%\Elgato\StreamDeck\Plugins\`, so **fully quit Stream Deck before building/installing**, then relaunch it afterward to pick up the change.

To do all of it in one go, run [`build-all.ps1`](build-all.ps1) from the repo root:

```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File build-all.ps1
```

It builds the Node plugin, the Node demo and the exe and packages all three into [`marketplace/`](marketplace/) (Node and exe into `full/`, the demo into `demo/`; add `-SkipPackage` to skip this) while Stream Deck keeps running, then quits Stream Deck just long enough to copy the three into its Plugins folder, and starts it again - even if the copy fails. If a build fails, Stream Deck is never closed. It needs the same tools as the individual builds: Node.js, CMake and Visual Studio 2022's C++ workload.

## Releasing

CI builds, tests and packages both plugins on every push. To release, bump [`shared/VERSION`](shared/VERSION), commit, and push a matching tag (`0.2.0` or `v0.2.0`; a `-suffix` such as `0.2.0-beta1` marks a prerelease). That drafts a GitHub release with both `.streamDeckPlugin` files and the exe's debug symbols attached; the release job fails if the tag doesn't match `shared/VERSION`.

## Notes

This uses undocumented and unsupported Windows APIs (the same ones, either way). These have apparently worked since Windows 7, but they might stop working at any time or have unexpected side effects.

This fork does not support macOS - the upstream project did, but maintaining and testing a Mac build isn't something this fork can commit to. If you're on a Mac, use [the original StreamDeck-AudioOutputSwitcher](https://github.com/fredemmott/StreamDeck-AudioOutputSwitcher) instead.

## Getting Help

Check the relevant troubleshooting guide first ([exe](audio-switcher-exe/TROUBLESHOOTING.md) / [node](audio-switcher-node/TROUBLESHOOTING.md)). If that doesn't help, you can reach me through GitHub by [opening an issue](https://github.com/morganscruggs/StreamDeck-AudioSwitcher/issues) - but I make this mainly for my own use, and share it in the hope that others find it useful, so I may be slow to respond.

## Thanks

- Thanks to [Fred Emmott](https://github.com/fredemmott) for creating the original [StreamDeck-AudioOutputSwitcher](https://github.com/fredemmott/StreamDeck-AudioOutputSwitcher) that this project is forked from.
- Thanks to "EreTIk" for finding/documenting the COM interface both implementations here rely on.
- Thanks to "LordValgor" for the idea of making this plugin.
